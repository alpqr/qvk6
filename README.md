Experiments for a Rendering Hardware Interface abstraction for Qt 6.

Relies on https://github.com/alpqr/qtshaderstack17 for shader management.

The API, the Vulkan, and the OpenGL (ES) 2.0 backends are reasonably complete
in the sense that it should be possible to bring up a Qt Quick renderer on top of them.
