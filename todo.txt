drop front-and-back cull?
gl setGraphicsPipeline should track srb->generation and issue BindGraphicsPipeline when different
d3d device loss
hlsl version to qsb (qtshaderstack17)
more what-if-resource-rebuilt cases
test FrameOpDeviceLost somehow
gles2: more ubuf types
gles2: reduce state, reduce texparam
tex/QImage formats
gles2: tex size stuff
test depth texture
depth only offscreen
mipmaps
cubemaps
anisotropic
compressed textures
adopt texture, buffer, ...
more tex: 3d, array
resize to 0 width or height fails (vk)
upgrade vkmemalloc
msaa offscreen
gles2: ubuf structs, arrays
gles2: target QOpenGLWindow ...

+++ done
d3d to track buffer, texture, sampler generation and update the buffer/srv/sampler in the batchedbinding lists
d3d setGraphicsPipeline should track srb->generation and issue BindGraphicsPipeline when different
scissor-enable flag
drop triangle fan
do something with offset and size in srb::Binding::uniformBuffer
start d3d11 backend
what if ps is rebuilt
move correctionmatrix to backend
remove some inlines in public api
hide virtuals
remove QVk*Private
buf rebuilt -> srb? srb rebuilt -> ps? texture rebuilt -> texture rt?
hide VkSurfaceKHR from api
vkcmdcopybuffertoimage
test upload+render-to (preserved)
barriers
rendertarget
scheduleRelease -> releaseLater (+ update recreate example)
static buffer -> gpu_only, staging cpu_only, vkCmdCopyBuffer
textures
msaastencil
depth
bring back startBinding
pipeline obj destroy (deferred d.list?)
shader resource if.
topology, cull
blend
